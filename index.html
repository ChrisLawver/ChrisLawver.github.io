            <p>Hello there! My name is Chris Lawver and I'm from Cleveland, Ohio. I first started learning to code on my
                own in 2020. I've always had an interest in the tech industry and I've found that I really enjoy
                learning new
                languages and writing code. </p>

            <p>I'm currently attending school at <a href="https://wecancodeit.org/" target="_blank">We Can Code It</a>
                to become a full stack software/web developer. I'll be graduating in April 2021. I have experience in
                C#, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and SQL,
                as well as pushing and pulling repositories using Git Bash and GitHub.</p>
